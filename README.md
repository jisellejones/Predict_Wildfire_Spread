## Project Overview - Predict Wildfire Spread

The purpose of this project is to try to predict where and how quickly a wildfire will spread based on
- fuel type
- weather patterns (wind, temperature, precipitation, drought conditions, . . .)
- location
- accessibility
- geography

## Main Question

Can we predict where and how quickly a wildfire will spread when given the location of the wildfire?

## Reason for topic selection
- Wildfires have seemed to be increasing over time in both frequency and intensity. These wildfires impact the lives of humans and animals in surrounding cities and states. The massive loss of forest and greenery may also accelerate the impacts of climate change. If we can predict the location, size, and spread of a wildfire, we may be able to decrease the amount of natural life lost.

### Questions arising from data

- Is there correlation between the amount of slashing (heavy, medium, thinning) and the size of a wildfire?
- Is there correlation between the average or median precipitation of the month the fire starts and the fire size?
- Is there correlation between the average or median precipitation of the year prior to the start of the fire and the fire size?
- How much correlation or difference is there in correlation between the fuel type and the fire size?
- Is there a way to determine the direction the fire will move from where it started?
- Can we predict the fire size using a supervised model, show it on a map and then overlay wind speed/direction to possibly indicate the fire location?
    - Then could we show surrounding cities/towns for possible resources or evacuation areas?
    
## Resources
-  Data Files on Heroku:
    -  wildfire_data

    - To connect with data
        - Step 1: If using local server install psycopg2
            - If using Google Colab, this first step is unnecessary
        - Step 2: In file: import psycopg2 as pg
        - Step 3: Use the following code - replace [table] is either wildfire_data or noaa_data
            - engine = pg.connect("dbname='d3r8dfuncb78iv' user='jrufhfiejfajri' host='ec2-52-200-155-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com' port='5432' password='9a7254d2151b5e3c280fe275dbba039acdc9190fbc167f64c564c449ca77af88'")

## Machine Learning Model - ML_Simple (Provisional Model)

### Feature Enineering (Target):

To predict fire severity, the total acres a fire consumed was binned into 5 levels of severity.  
-  Class 1 - 10 acres or less;
-  Class 2 - 10 acres or more,, but less than 100 acres;
-  Class 3 - 100 acres or more, but less than 1000 acres;
-  Class 4 - 1000 acres or more, but less than 10,000 acres;
-  Class 5 - 10,000 acres or more.

With the initial class sizes, we could determine a large skew in the Class 1 fires.

-  Class 1 - 31989
-  Class 2 - 1131
-  Class 3 - 404
-  Class 4 - 135
-  Class 5 - 96

### Feature Enineering (Features): 
From the Oregon Department of Forestry dataset (1990 - 2021) we used General Cause, Fire Year, Latitude, Longitude, and Fuel Model.

### Machine Learning Model:
We choose to start with Random Forest Classifier for two reasons:

1.  Ability to rank features by importance.
2.  Predict outcomes based on our testing features.

### Results:

### Limitations:
RFC does great with classification but not regression.  The model would have a difficult time with precise and continous predictions.  There is also a high chance the trees have there own condtions, such as:
-  Class Imbalance
-  Sample Duplicatiom
-  Overfitting
-  Node Splitting 


## Machine Learning Model - ML_Fire

### ETL:
To match our future weather features merge, the years for the fire data were adjusted to 2008 - 2020.

### Feature Engineering Changes(Target):  
For our target, we determined there was value in following a recognized fire classification system.  The levels were changed to match how the National Wildfire Coordinating Group classifies fires. https://www.nwcg.gov/term/glossary/size-class-of-fire.  After running the model with the changed class sizes, we saw a decrease in accuracy across the model.  Therefore, the class sizes were adjusted to follow a 3 class system from USDA Forest Service: https://www.fs.fed.us/nwacfire/home/terminology.html.


### Fire Classes - National Wildfire Coordinating Group vs USDA Forest Service 

### National Wildfire Coordinating Group

-  Class 1 - one-fourth acre or less;
-  Class 2 - more than one-fourth acre, but less than 10 acres;
-  Class 3 - 10 acres or more, but less than 100 acres;
-  Class 4 - 100 acres or more, but less than 300 acres;
-  Class 5 - 300 acres or more, but less than 1,000 acres;
-  Class 6 - 1,000 acres or more, but less than 5,000 acres;
-  Class 7 - 5,000 acres or more.

With the class sizes, there is still a large skew in the Class 1 fires.

-  Class 1 - 8947
-  Class 2 - 2805
-  Class 3 - 478
-  Class 4 - 101
-  Class 5 - 56
-  Class 6 - 47
-  Class 7 - 70

### USDA Forest Service 

-  Class 1 - one-fourth acre or less;
-  Class 2 - more than one-fourth acre, but less than 300 acres;
-  Class 7 - 300 acres or more.

There is still a large skew in class 1 but slight balance added to class 2 and class 3.

-  Class 1 - 8947
-  Class 2 - 3384
-  Class 3 - 173

### Feature Enineering Changes (Features):
-  Date range adjusted to 2008 - 2020
-  General cause binned into 3 categories; human, nature, undetermined/misc

### Machine Learning Model:  
To account for our overfitting with class 1 fires, another ML was created for Combination Sampling With SMOTEENN.

-  Removing null values dropped total rows from 12,577 to 10,048.

### Feature Enineering Changes (Target): None

### Feature Enineering Changes (Features):  
Added new rows containing weather data to the model.
- Temperature Min AVG
- Temperature Max AVG

### Machine Learning Model:  
Overall accuracy decreased from ML_Fire, with the most significant change being predictions in class 3 fire severity.

## Challenge Summary
- Finding usable data - reviewed data on several different platforms.  Data formats where the biggest hurrdle.  Found 2 sources that provided data in .csv
- Merging weather data - downloaded data by county (37 total) for the state of Oregon which resulted in over 1 million rows of data.  Initially tried to merge via PGAdmin.  Due to varying column inclusion by county, the schema would have been 40+ columns wide.  Due to the data width, the team pivoted to using pandas to merge the data which was more efficient. 
- Determination of useful variables - Currently working on the proper threshold level to determine whether to keep certain columns based upon % of NaN.

## Predict Wildfire Spread  - Results
- Preliminary findings 11.06.2021 
    - Feature Importance from Random Classifier 11.06.2021
        - Longitude/Latitude/fire_year - shows the greatest weight on fire size (0.017 - 0.36)
    - General Cause of Fire
        - Equipment use shows the greatest weight for cause of wildfire (0.009)
            - Considering binning "general cause" of fire into two categories: human causes and natural causes
    - Fuel Model (A - X)
        - "Annual Grasses" (A) show the greatest weight on fire size (0.009)
        - "Dense Chaparral" (B) show the least weight on fire size (0.001)
